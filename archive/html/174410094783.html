 Norwegian duo »Soft as Snow« makes leftfield psych-out Pop “next to the
 bleeding edge of dance music”. Imagine »Fever Ray« twice, armed with 
laser guns trying to make analogue synth-pop songs at a 90&rsquo;s Warp 
Records showcase. Mesmerizing, pervasive, uncanny!<br/><br/>Soft As Snow 
just released their debut album on Houndstooth. It was created by band 
members Oda Egjar Starheim and Øystein Monsen, with additional mixing 
and production by WIFE of Tri Angle Records<br/><br/><br/><a href="https://www.facebook.com/noisyanswer/" target="_blank">Noisy answer</a> (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/supakclovesyou/" target="_blank">supaKC</a>)<br/><br/>Noisy
 Answer is the freshest alias of Leipzig-based DJ &amp; producer 
»supaKC« indulging her passion for dreamy, drum-machine driven dance 
music and expressive synth sounds.
